# JavaScript 
     It is a client side programing scripting language (High level)
     used to create applications(desktop/mobile/GUI/Cli/Web)

## To Print 
     Console.log()/windows.console.log()

## Features
1. Dynamic Typing: JavaScript doesn't require variable types to be explicitly declared.
2. Event-driven: Commonly used for handling events such as clicks, user input, etc.
3. Asynchronous Programming: Supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
4. Cross-platform: Works across different platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop.
5. Object-Oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.


## Ram 
    two types of memory in ram 1.stack, 2.heap
    Heap: Works on Dma(Dynamic memory allocatiion) Concept.
JavaScript, memory management involves two main structures: the stack and the heap.
### Stack
    Static Memory Allocation: The stack is used for static memory allocation. It stores primitive types (like numbers, strings, and booleans) and function calls.
    it cant expand.
    Dyanamic memory
### Heap
    Dynamic Memory Allocation: The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. It stores objects, arrays, and other reference types.
    it can expand
    static memory

## Variables
1. let
2. const
3. var

## Reassign or Redeclare
Variables - Variables declared with let or var can be reassigned, but const cannot be reassigned.
    var allows redeclaration in the same scope, while let and const do not.


## Data types
    it is used to define Variables and used to reserve memory space
### Primitive Data Types:
1. string
2. number
3. booleans = true/false
4. undefined 
5. null

### Object {}
    Object of an array = {text: [{}, {}, {}]}
### Array []
    array of an object  = [{}]
### Date 
    used to assign dates

## When to Use Data Types:
     Numbers: Use number data type when performing arithmetic calculations.
     Strings: Strings are typically used for text data and consume less space compared to arrays and objects.


## Dma = Dynamic memory allocation
    DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation): Memory is allocated dynamically during runtime, allowing for flexible memory use. JavaScript uses this concept with its heap for objects and arrays.

## Operators 

### Arithmetic Operators 
`(+, -, *, /, %, **)`

### Comparison Operators 
`(==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=)`

### Logical Operators 
`&& (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)`

### Ternary Operator 
`(Condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false)`

### Assignment Operators 
`(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)`

### Increment and Decrement Operators 
`(++, --)`

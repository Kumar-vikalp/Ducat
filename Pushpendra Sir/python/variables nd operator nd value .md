x=10
y=20
z=x+y
print("value of z is",z)

x - variabble/identifier
= - operator
10 - value/data

right to left 
10 is stored in x

so that first right side will be solved 
x+y  (the value we get when we solve x+y will be stored in z)

if there is any variable in the right side of the =(operator) like x=y then it will treated as a value
if there was any sum then it will be xy
but it doesnt become xy and becomes 30(10+20) stored in z

converting one data to other data is knon as typecasting
